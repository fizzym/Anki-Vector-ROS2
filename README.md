# Anki-Vector-ROS2

Ros2 provides a great developement plateform for creating a controller for the Anki Vector robots.

This repository includes a rough version of a Ros2 driver for the Vector robot, as well as information about what functionality should be included when creating a better version of the driver.

The wiki section covers information learned about the Anki Vector SDK, Ros2, OSKR, and the Vector Driver.

Usefull CAD models for demos are also included and discussed.
