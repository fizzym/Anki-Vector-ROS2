CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:37 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findstd_masgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "std_masgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "std_masgs" with
  any of the following names:

    std_masgsConfig.cmake
    std_masgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "std_masgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "std_masgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "std_masgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
